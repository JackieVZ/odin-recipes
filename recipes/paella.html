    <p>Classic Spanish rice dish made with rice, saffron, vegetables, chicken, and seafood cooked and served in one pan.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>300g paella or risotto rice</li>
        <li>3 tbsp dry sherry or white wine (optional)</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes with garlic</li>
        <li>900ml chicken stock</li>
        <li>400g frozen seafood mix</li>
        <li>1 lemon, ½ juiced, ½ cut into wedges</li>

        <li>Add the onion and soften for 5 mins.</li>
